          required: true
        - label: I have installed the **latest** release version of the integration and home assistant.
          required: true
        - label: I have prepared DEBUG log output (for technical issues) | In most of the cases of a technical error/issue I would have the need to ask for DEBUG log output of the integration. There is a short [tutorial/guide 'How to provide DEBUG log' here](https://github.com/marq24/ha-senec-v3/blob/master/docs/HA_DEBUG.md)
          required: true
        - label: I understand the SHIT-__IN__ - SHIT-__OUT__ principle (in case of implausible data) | It will happen, that the data that is displayed by this integration does not make much sense (to you) - Of course this could be always the case, that something in this integration has been messed up - but so far - in all reported issues the root cause of implausible data was/is, that the SENEC.Home device itself already provided this data
          required: true
        - label: I confirm it's really an issue | In the case that you want to understand the functionality of a certain feature/sensor Please be so kind and make use if the discussion feature of this repo (and do not create an issue) - TIA
        - label: |
            I confirm, that I did not read any of the previous bulletin-points and just checked them all. | I don't wanted to waste my time with details, I don't read or follow any existing instructions. | Instead, I want that the maintainer of this repo will spend time explaining the world to me â€” that's marq24's job!. | I live by the motto: Better to ask twice, than to think about it once. | It's marq24's own fault that he provides open-source software and is willing to offer free support.
